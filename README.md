## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the topics directory (`/topics`) to read about different Rust concepts.
3. Navigate to the source code directory (`/src`) to access the practice exercises and examples.
4. Use a Rust compiler and build tool (such as Cargo) to compile and run the code.

Make sure to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine before running the code. You can visit the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org) for installation instructions.
